## Underfitting and Overfitting in Machine Learning

### 🔹 Underfitting

**Definition**:  
Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. It fails to learn from both the training data and the test data.

**Symptoms**:
- Low accuracy on training data.
- Low accuracy on test/validation data.

**Causes**:
- Model is too simple (e.g., linear model for non-linear data).
- Insufficient features.
- Too much regularization.
- Not enough training time or iterations.

**Example**:
Using a linear regression model to fit a highly non-linear dataset.

### 🔹 Overfitting

**Definition**:  
Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and learns not only the underlying patterns but also the noise in the training data. It performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.

**Symptoms**:
- High accuracy on training data.
- Low accuracy on test/validation data.

**Causes**:
- Model is too complex (e.g., deep decision trees or high-degree polynomials).
- Too little training data.
- Noisy data without proper cleaning.
- Lack of regularization.

**Example**:
A decision tree that perfectly classifies training data but fails on new data.

## ✅ How to Prevent Underfitting and Overfitting

| Technique                          | Helps Prevent |
|-----------------------------------|----------------|
| Increase model complexity         | Underfitting    |
| Add more relevant features        | Underfitting    |
| Reduce regularization             | Underfitting    |
| Use a simpler model               | Overfitting     |
| Collect more training data        | Overfitting     |
| Use cross-validation              | Overfitting     |
| Apply regularization (e.g., L1/L2)| Overfitting     |
| Early stopping (for NN)           | Overfitting     |
| Prune decision trees              | Overfitting     |
| Use dropout (for NN)              | Overfitting     |

## 🧠 Preventing Underfitting and Overfitting — 

### 🎯 Scenario: Predict if a student is "At Risk" or "On Track"
Using data like study hours, attendance, and grades.

---

## 🔹 Underfitting (Too simple)
**Signs**: Bad performance on both training and testing.

**Fix it by**:
- ✅ Using a more complex model (e.g., Random Forest instead of Linear)
- ✅ Adding better features (e.g., Engagement = Hours × Attendance)
- ✅ Training for more time
- ✅ Reducing regularization

---

## 🔹 Overfitting (Too complex)
**Signs**: Great on training, poor on new data.

**Fix it by**:
- ✅ Simplifying the model (e.g., smaller tree depth)
- ✅ Using regularization (like L2)
- ✅ Applying Dropout or Early Stopping
- ✅ Getting more or cleaner data
- ✅ Using cross-validation

---

⚖️ **Goal**: Balance both to get a model that generalizes well.

## 📉 How to Detect Overfitting vs Underfitting from a Plot

When given a **training vs. validation error plot** (or accuracy plot), here’s how to identify the issue:

---

### 🔹 Underfitting

**What you’ll see in the plot**:
- Both training and validation errors are **high**.
- There's **no gap** between them.
- Model doesn’t improve much with more training.

**Interpretation**:
- The model is too simple to learn the patterns.
  
✅ **Fix**: Use a more complex model, add better features.

---

### 🔹 Overfitting

**What you’ll see in the plot**:
- Training error is **very low**.
- Validation error is **much higher**.
- There's a **big gap** between the two curves.

**Interpretation**:
- The model memorized the training data but doesn't generalize.

✅ **Fix**: Use regularization, simplify the model, or get more data.

---

### 🎯 Ideal Plot

- Training and validation errors are **both low**.
- The gap between them is **small**.
- This shows the model is generalizing well.
